Decentralized File Storage System
The Decentralized File Storage System is designed to allow users to store, share, and manage 
files across a distributed network of nodes, enhancing fault tolerance, security, and privacy. 
Files are distributed across multiple nodes (peers) to ensure that no single authority controls 
the system. The following document outlines the core features, architecture, and technologies 
to be used in the system. 
Core Features (Minimum Viable Product) 
1. File Upload/Download: Users can upload and download files from the system, which 
are distributed across nodes in smaller chunks. 
2. User Authentication: A basic login/registration system to manage user access and 
private storage. 
3. File Sharing: Users can share files with others via links or unique permissions. 
4. Data Replication: Files are replicated across multiple nodes for redundancy. 
5. Basic Encryption: Files are encrypted before upload to ensure privacy. 
6. Node Management: A system for managing user nodes and their contributions to the 
decentralized network. 
Technologies to be Used 
1. IDE (VS Code): Development will be conducted using a modern IDE like 
VS Code, supporting various programming languages such as JavaScript, Python, or 
Java. 
2. Frontend Framework (Angular or React): The frontend will be developed using 
Angular or React to create a dynamic and responsive user interface for functionalities 
like file upload, download, and management. 
3. UML Editor (Visual Paradigm): UML diagrams will be designed using a tool like 
Visual Paradigm to illustrate the system architecture, including class, sequence, and 
deployment diagrams. 
4. Code Repository (GitHub): Source code will be hosted on GitHub allowing for version control and collaboration. 
5. RDBMS (e.g., MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server): An RDBMS will be used to manage user 
authentication data and access permissions. 
6. NoSQL DBMS (e.g., MongoDB): A NoSQL database like MongoDB will store metadata 
related to files, chunks, and nodes, ensuring scalability and flexibility. 
7. REST Client (e.g., Postman): Postman will be used for testing RESTful APIs, which 
handle file operations and user management. 
8. SOAP Client (e.g., SOAPUI): SOAPUI will be employed to test any SOAP-based web 
services required for specific integrations. 
9. Container Software (e.g., Docker): Docker will be utilized to containerize the 
application, making it easier to deploy across different environments. 
10. UI Testing Client/Software (e.g., Selenium): Selenium will automate UI testing to 
validate core functionalities such as file upload/download. 
11. Cloud Deployment (e.g., AWS, Azure, Google Cloud): The application will be deployed 
on cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud for scalability and availability. 
12. CI/CD Pipeline: Continuous integration and deployment will be configured using tools 
like GitHub Actions to automate testing and cloud deployment
